Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for World Environment Day in a school. The program should set green lighting effects, play nature sounds in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages about environmental conservation every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special presentation or talk starts, stopping all sounds.
