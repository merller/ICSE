The program should set smart lights to blue, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play soothing music, display informative content about Down syndrome every 5 minutes, and display images or videos every 10 minutes. The informative content should include 'Down syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of all or part of a third copy of chromosome 21.', 'People with Down syndrome have an extra chromosome that impacts their physical and cognitive development.', and 'Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal condition, affecting approximately 1 in 700 births.'
