Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for World Population Day in a school. The program should set light blue lighting effects, play educational content about population issues in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages about global population trends and challenges every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special presentation or talk starts, stopping all content playback.

Simplified description: create a scene that includes setting up informative lighting, playing educational content about population issues, displaying messages about global population trends and challenges, and managing the thermostat for comfort. Additionally, we can use smart displays to show images or videos related to population growth, demographics, and sustainability.
