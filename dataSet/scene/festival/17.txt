Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to set a cozy atmosphere for World Poetry Day in a home with children. The program should set smart lights to purple and blue, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play soothing music, display poetry every 2 minutes, and recite the poetry using a voice assistant after 5 minutes. The poetry should include 'A poem is a little path', 'That leads you through the trees.', 'It takes you to the cliffs and shores,', and 'To anywhere you please.'

Simplified description: create a scene that includes setting up cozy lighting, playing soothing music, displaying poetry on smart displays, and managing the thermostat for comfort. Additionally, we can use voice assistants to recite poems and encourage children to create their own poetry.
