Detailed description: This code defines a JavaScript routine to create a festive atmosphere for New Year's Day. It begins by setting the smart lights' color to red, green, blue, and golden in sequence every 15 minutes. Simultaneously, it plays four different New Year's songs every 30 minutes. Additionally, it sends four New Year's greetings messages every hour. The routine also sets the thermostat temperature to a cozy 22Â°C, starts a countdown timer to midnight, and triggers a fireworks display after an hour. Finally, the code checks if today is New Year's Day (January 1st) and executes the festive routine if it is, logging messages to indicate whether it's New Year's Day or not.
