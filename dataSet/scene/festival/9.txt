Detailed description: Write a JavaScript program to create a nostalgic atmosphere for World Radio Day on February 13th in a museum setting. The program should set smart lights to soft orange and warm red, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play historic radio broadcasts every 30 minutes, display information about radio history and significance every 15 minutes, and show images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. It should check if today is February 13th before running the routine and simulate a special presentation starting after 1 hour.
