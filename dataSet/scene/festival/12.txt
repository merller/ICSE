Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to set an inclusive atmosphere for Zero Discrimination Day on March 1st in a college setting. The program should set smart lights to rainbow and soft purple, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play inspirational content every 30 minutes, display messages promoting diversity and inclusion every 15 minutes, and show images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. It should check if today is March 1st before running the routine and simulate a special presentation starting after 1 hour.
