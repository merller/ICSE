The program should set soft orange lighting effects, play calming and reflective music in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages promoting charity and community service every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special activity or presentation starts, stopping all music playback.
