Detailed description:Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for International Asteroid Day in a museum. The program should set dark blue lighting effects, play space-related sounds or informative content in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages about asteroids and space science every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special presentation or talk starts, stopping all content playback.
