The program should set smart lights to soft purple and gentle blue, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play motivational or educational content every 30 minutes, display messages related to social justice every 15 minutes, and show images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. It should check if today is February 20th before running the routine and simulate a special presentation starting after 1 hour.
