Detailed description:Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for World Post Day in a post office. The program should set celebratory lighting effects, play postal-themed music at 30-minute intervals, display messages about the importance of mail and communication every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should handle the event when a special activity or celebration starts, stopping the music playback.
