Detailed description:Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for United Nations Day in a school setting. The program should set celebratory lighting effects, play uplifting background music at 30-minute intervals before the event starts, display informative messages about the United Nations every 15 minutes, and display slides or relevant information on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should handle the event when the main presentation or celebration starts, stopping the background music playback.
