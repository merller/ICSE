Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to set a calming atmosphere for Fighting Islamic Phobia International Day on March 15th in a museum. The program should set smart lights to soft blue and soft green, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play educational content every 30 minutes, display messages promoting understanding and tolerance every 15 minutes, and show images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. It should check if today is March 15th before running the routine and simulate a special presentation starting after 1 hour.

Simplified description: Create a scene that includes setting up calming lighting, playing educational content, displaying messages promoting understanding and tolerance, and managing the thermostat for comfort.
