Detailed description:Create a JavaScript program to simulate an atmosphere for World Refugee Day in a museum. The program should set soft blue lighting effects, play educational content in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages about the plight of refugees and their contributions every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special presentation or talk starts, stopping all content playback.
