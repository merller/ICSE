Detailed description: Create a JavaScript program to set a celebratory atmosphere for International Women's Day on March 8th in a shopping mall. The program should set smart lights to pink and purple, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, play empowering music every 30 minutes, display messages celebrating women's achievements every 15 minutes, and show images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. It should check if today is March 8th before running the routine and simulate a special presentation starting after 1 hour.

Simplified description: Create a scene that includes setting up pink and purple lighting, playing empowering music, displaying messages celebrating women's achievements, and managing the thermostat for comfort. Additionally, we can use smart displays to show images or videos highlighting women's contributions to society.
