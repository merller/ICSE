Detailed description: Write a JavaScript program to create an atmosphere for Data Protection Day on January 28th in a conference room. The program should set smart lights to cool white and soft blue, play ambient background music before the speech, stop the music when the professor starts speaking, and adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C. It should also display informational messages about data protection every 15 minutes and show relevant slides every 20 minutes. The program should check if today is January 28th before running the routine, and simulate the professor starting to speak after 1 minute.
