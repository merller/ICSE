Detailed description: Write a JavaScript program to create a calm and respectful atmosphere for World Cancer Day on February 4th in a hospital setting. The program should set smart lights to soft blue and gentle white, adjust the thermostat to a comfortable 22Â°C, display informative messages about cancer awareness every 15 minutes, and show relevant slides every 20 minutes. It should check if today is February 4th before running the routine and simulate the main presentation starting after 1 hour.

Simplified description: Create a scene in a hospital setting that includes setting up appropriate lighting, displaying informative messages about cancer awareness and prevention, and managing the thermostat for comfort. Additionally, we can display slides or relevant information on a smart display.
