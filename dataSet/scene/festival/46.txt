The program should set silver lighting effects, play space-related sounds or informative content about the moon in a loop every 30 minutes, display messages about lunar exploration and the importance of the moon every 15 minutes, and display images or videos on a smart display every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should include a function to handle the event when a special presentation or talk starts, stopping all content playback.
