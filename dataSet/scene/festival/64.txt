The program should set smart lights color to white in studios and soft blue in common areas, play educational background audio or announcements in common areas at 30-minute intervals, display informative messages about media literacy every 15 minutes, and display slides or relevant information on smart displays every 20 minutes. Additionally, the program should handle the event when the main presentation or segment starts, stopping the background audio playback.
