//The morningEnergyRoutine begins by checking the solar panel output to determine available energy. It then manages the battery level based on solar output, charging it if low or discharging if high. Next, it adjusts appliance usage according to real-time electricity pricing, turning off non-essential appliances during high prices and utilizing solar and battery power during low prices. The eveningEnergyRoutine adjusts energy usage based on the day's patterns, responding to real-time electricity prices by optimizing appliance usage. It also ensures lights are turned on. The nightEnergyRoutine minimizes energy consumption by turning off heating, air conditioning, and lights. Finally, it prepares for the next day's energy management.
