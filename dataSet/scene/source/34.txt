Detailed Description:

The Smart Museum Scene starts by activating the security system, turning on exhibit lights, setting the ambient temperature to 22Â°C, and starting the visitor tracking system. Notifications are sent to staff. When a visitor enters the exhibit area, a notification is sent, a welcome message is played, and lighting is adjusted for the visitor. If an exhibit is touched, a notification is sent, and the exhibit alarm is activated. In case of overcrowding, a notification is sent, and visitors are redirected. If a fire is detected, a fire alarm is activated, emergency exits are opened, and an evacuation notification is sent. When a visitor leaves the exhibit area, a notification is sent.
