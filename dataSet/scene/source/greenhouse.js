//The morning routine ensures the greenhouse environment is set up for optimal plant growth by controlling temperature to 25째C, humidity to 60%, turning on the greenhouse lighting, and watering plants in zone 1 where soil moisture is monitored. In the afternoon, adjustments are made to maintain optimal conditions with the temperature increased to 28째C and additional watering of plants in zone 2 based on soil moisture levels. Evening routines focus on preparing the greenhouse for the night, including adjusting temperature to 22째C, increasing humidity to 70%, turning off the lighting, and watering plants in zone 3.
//The morning routine ensures the greenhouse environment is optimized for plant health by setting temperature, humidity, and lighting, and watering plants in zone 1 based on soil moisture levels. In the afternoon, adjustments are made to maintain optimal conditions and water plants in zone 2 as needed. Evening routines prepare the greenhouse for nighttime conditions, adjusting environmental factors and watering plants in zone 3.
