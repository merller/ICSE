Detailed Description:

The Smart Water Management Scene starts by activating the security system, smart water management system, irrigation optimization, and flood prevention measures. Notifications are sent to staff. When a water level change is detected, a notification is sent, water flow is adjusted, and if necessary, flood control measures are activated. When irrigation is needed, a notification is sent, irrigation is started, and the irrigation log is updated. If a water quality anomaly is detected, a notification is sent, the issue is investigated, and water purification is activated. Weather alerts trigger a notification and preparation of flood prevention measures. Equipment failure triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and activation of backup systems.
