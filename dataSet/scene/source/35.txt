Detailed Description:

The Smart Grid Scene starts by activating power generation, power distribution, and energy monitoring systems. Notifications are sent to the control center. When peak demand is detected, a notification is sent, additional power sources are activated, and demand response measures are initiated. If a power outage is detected in an area, a notification is sent, repair crews are dispatched, and power flow is redirected. Abnormal energy consumption triggers an investigation and adjustment of energy supply. Increased renewable energy supply prompts an adjustment of grid distribution and storage of excess energy. High temperature detection activates cooling systems for power stations.

Concise Description:

The Smart Grid Scene activates power generation, distribution, and monitoring. It sends notifications and responds to peak demand, power outages, abnormal energy consumption, increased renewable energy, and high temperatures with actions such as activating power sources, dispatching repair crews, investigating issues, adjusting grid distribution, and activating cooling systems.

Ultra-Concise Description:

The Smart Grid Scene manages power generation, distribution, and monitoring, responding to peak demand, outages, abnormal consumption, renewable energy increases, and high temperatures with appropriate actions and notifications.
