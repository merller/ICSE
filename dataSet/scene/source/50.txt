Detailed Description:

The Smart Fishery Management Scene starts by activating the fishery monitoring system, underwater sensors, surveillance drones, and water quality control system. Notifications are sent to managers. When a fish health anomaly is detected, a notification is sent, the issue is investigated, and the feeding schedule is adjusted. Water quality anomalies trigger a notification, activation of the water purification system, and water sample collection. When a drone completes a survey, a notification is sent, the data is analyzed, and fish population data is updated. Water temperature changes trigger a notification, adjustment of water temperature control, and notification to the fish farm manager. Illegal fishing detection triggers a notification, alerting authorities, and dispatching a patrol drone.
