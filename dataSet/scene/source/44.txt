Detailed Description:

The Smart Kitchen Management Scene starts by activating the smart fridge, monitoring food inventory, and activating the recipe suggestion system. Notifications are sent to the user. When food inventory is updated, a notification is sent, the inventory is checked, and recipes are suggested. When food is expiring soon, a notification is sent, and recipes using that food item are suggested. When food is out of stock, a notification is sent, and the item is added to the shopping list. Shopping list updates trigger a notification. Food waste detection triggers a notification, updates the food waste log, and suggests ways to reduce waste.
