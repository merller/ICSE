Detailed Description:

The Smart Clothing Scene starts by turning on wearable sensors and activating the smart heating feature. Notifications are sent to the user. When a health anomaly is detected, a notification is sent, health data is recorded, and the healthcare provider is notified. If a temperature change is detected, a notification is sent, and the smart heating is adjusted accordingly. Low battery detection triggers a notification and activates power-saving mode. If a firmware update is needed, a notification is sent, and the update process is started.
