Detailed Description:

The Smart Baby Monitoring Scene starts by activating the baby monitor, health monitoring, and environmental controls. Notifications are sent to parents. When the baby falls asleep, a notification is sent, and sleep monitoring begins. When the baby wakes up, a notification is sent, and sleep monitoring stops. Health anomalies detected trigger a notification, alerting parents, and recording health data. Environmental anomalies trigger a notification and adjustment of the environment. When the baby cries, a notification is sent, parents are alerted, and soothing music is played.
