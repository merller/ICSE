Detailed Description:

The Smart Amusement Park Scene starts by activating the security system, smart ticketing system, virtual reality rides, and personalized services. Notifications are sent to staff and visitors. When a visitor enters the park, a welcome notification is sent, personalized services are assigned, and a park map is provided. Peak visitor levels trigger a notification and optimization of ride wait times. When a virtual reality ride starts, a notification is sent, and ride usage is tracked. Help requests from visitors trigger a notification and dispatch of assistance. In case of an emergency, an evacuation protocol is initiated, and visitors are guided to exits.
