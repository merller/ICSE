Detailed Description:

The Smart Airport Scene starts by activating the security system, automatic baggage handling system, smart security check, and personalized navigation. Notifications are sent to staff and passengers. When a baggage scan anomaly is detected, a notification is sent, the baggage handling is paused, and security is alerted. When a passenger approaches the security check, a notification is sent, and the security check is prepared. Once a passenger clears security, a notification is sent, and personalized navigation is provided. Flight information updates trigger a notification and update navigation information. In case of an emergency, an evacuation protocol is initiated, and passengers are guided to exits.
