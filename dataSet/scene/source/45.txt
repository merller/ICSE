Detailed Description:

The Smart Elevator Management Scene starts by activating the elevator system, monitoring elevator usage, and activating optimization algorithms. Notifications are sent to users. When a user calls the elevator, a notification is sent, and the elevator is dispatched to the specified floor. When the elevator arrives, a notification is sent, the doors open, and the usage is logged. Peak hours detection triggers a notification, optimization of the elevator schedule, and grouping of requests by proximity. Elevator failure detection triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and activation of a backup elevator. In case of an emergency, an emergency protocol is activated, and users are guided to exits.

Concise Description:
