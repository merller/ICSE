Detailed Description:

The Smart Car Sharing Scene starts by activating the car sharing system, vehicle fleet, and mobile app integration. Notifications are sent to users. When a user books a vehicle, a notification is sent, the vehicle is reserved, and a booking confirmation is sent to the user. When the user arrives at the vehicle and unlocks it, a notification is sent, trip tracking starts, and the vehicle status is updated to 'in use'. When the user ends the trip, a notification is sent, trip tracking stops, the vehicle status is updated to 'available', the trip cost is calculated, and an invoice is sent to the user. Vehicle failure detection triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and updating the vehicle status to 'out of service'. When a vehicle needs cleaning, a notification is sent, a cleaning team is dispatched, and the vehicle status is updated to 'cleaning'.
