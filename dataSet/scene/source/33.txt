Detailed Description:

The Smart Inventory Management Scene starts by activating the security system, turning on warehouse lights, and starting inventory tracking. Notifications are sent to staff. When low inventory is detected for an item, a notification is sent, and stock is ordered. Upon the arrival of new stock, inventory is updated, and a notification is sent. If an inventory error is detected, a notification is sent, and the inventory is audited. If high temperature is detected in the warehouse, the cooling system is activated, and a high-temperature warning is sent.
