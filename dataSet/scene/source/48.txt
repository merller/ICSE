Detailed Description:

The Smart Delivery Scene starts by activating the delivery system, drone fleet, and autonomous vehicle fleet. Notifications are sent to staff. When a package is ready, a notification is sent, and both drone and autonomous vehicle deliveries are scheduled. When a drone starts a delivery, a notification is sent, and the drone's location is tracked. Similarly, when an autonomous vehicle starts a delivery, a notification is sent, and the vehicle's location is tracked. Upon completion of drone or autonomous vehicle delivery, notifications are sent, and the package status is updated to 'delivered'. Drone and vehicle failures trigger notifications, dispatch of repair teams, and rescheduling of deliveries.
