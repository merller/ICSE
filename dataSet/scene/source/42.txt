Detailed Description:

The Smart Event Management Scene starts by activating the security system, smart wristbands, QR code scanners, and deploying sensors. Notifications are sent to staff and participants. When a participant checks in, a notification is sent, the participant's location is tracked, and the event schedule is provided. Crowd detection triggers a notification and crowd control measures. When a participant scans a QR code, a notification is sent, and the QR code data is processed. In case of an emergency, an evacuation protocol is initiated, and participants are guided to exits. Equipment failure triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and activation of backup systems.
