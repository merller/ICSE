//These traffic management routines dynamically adjust traffic lights based on real-time congestion levels. The morning routine focuses on optimizing traffic flow in downtown during rush hour. In the afternoon, traffic management shifts to midtown to handle peak hours efficiently. The evening routine ensures smooth traffic flow in uptown while prioritizing emergency vehicles on the main road.
//Daily traffic routines optimize flow during key times: morning in downtown, afternoon in midtown, and evening in uptown. Traffic lights adjust based on congestion levels to maintain efficient traffic flow. Evening routines include prioritizing emergency vehicles, ensuring effective management throughout the day.
//Daily traffic routines adapt traffic light settings to manage congestion effectively in downtown, midtown, and uptown areas
