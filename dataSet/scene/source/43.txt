Detailed Description:

The Smart Library Scene starts by activating the security system, auto borrow/return system, eBook system, and smart recommendation system. Notifications are sent to staff and users. When a user borrows a book, a notification is sent, inventory status is updated, borrowing history is tracked, and book recommendations are provided. When a user returns a book, a notification is sent, inventory status is updated, and the book is cleaned and sorted. When a user logs into the eBook system, a notification is sent, and eBook recommendations are provided. Low inventory detection triggers a notification and book reordering. In case of an emergency, an evacuation protocol is initiated, and users are guided to exits. Equipment failure triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and activation of backup systems.
