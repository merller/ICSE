Detailed Description:

The Smart School Scene starts by activating the security system, smart classroom management system, and online learning platform. Notifications are sent to students and staff. When a class starts, a notification is sent, interactive teaching devices are turned on, and attendance tracking begins. When a class ends, a notification is sent, interactive teaching devices are turned off, and attendance records are saved. When a student logs into the online learning platform, a notification is sent, learning resources are provided, and learning progress is tracked. Equipment failure detection triggers a notification, dispatch of a repair team, and activation of backup equipment. In case of an emergency, an evacuation protocol is initiated, and students and staff are guided to exits.
